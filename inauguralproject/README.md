# Introduction
The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.


This inargural project has been made with an objective to learn how to solve, construct and present a labour supply problem properly using Python. Firstly, an utility function is optimized in task 1 given a budget constraint. Secondly, the optimal consumtion c* and the optimal labour supply l* are illustrated in a graph given a population of N = 10.000 and an uniform distribution of wages. 

Afterwards, the total tax revenue is calculated under to different assumptions; a Frisch elasiticity of labour supply of 0.3 in task 3 and 0.1 in task 4. 

Finally, optimal standard labor income tax, optimal top bracket labor income tax, and optimal cut-off for the top labour income bracket is calculated with an objective to maximize the total tax revenue.
